# Adding Images

Compress images before uploading them.

## Image Compression

We recommend using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) for your images, since it
produces small, quality images for both JPG and PNG. If you have Adobe
Photoshop, there is a function to
[export to web](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/creativesuite/cs/using/WS6E857477-27FE-4a88-B8A4-074DC3C65F68.html).
Other useful compression sites are [Optimizilla](http://optimizilla.com/) and
[jpeg.io](https://www.jpeg.io/).

A batch alternative is pngquant - https://pngquant.org/ (install via homebrew).

## Publication Images

For every publication, you **MUST** provide two images and stored in the `assets/publication-images/` directory.

1. a thumbnail:

Named: `YYYY_CONFSHORTNAME_PAPERSHORTNAME.png`

Dimensions: ~ 400x200 (keep a 2:1 aspect ratio)

File Size: < 40 KB

2. a teaser

Named: `YYYY_CONFSHORTNAME_PAPERSHORTNAME_teaser.png`

Dimensions: 1200x600 (keep a 2:1 aspect ratio)

File Size: 200-300 kb

## Personal Images

All active members should add a headshot to the [assets/photos](https://github.com/viscollective/viscollective.github.io/tree/main/assets/photos) folder, or you will have a nice cat filler image :)

The image should be 370 pixels x 370 pixels.

Name it {last_name}.

It should be a jpg.
