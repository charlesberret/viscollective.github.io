# Vis Collective Lab Website

The Vis Collective Lab Website draws inspo (& code) from the [Vis Design Lab](https://github.com/visdesignlab/visdesignlab.github.io) and is built with Jekyll.

## If you want to set up the site locally do this (but you don't have to):

### Setup Jekyll

To set up Jekyll, make sure you have ruby and bundler. Then run:

`bundle install`
Further details on installing Jekyll and its requirements: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/

### Run Jekyll

`jekyll serve -i`
Running Jekyll in incremental (-i) mode is significantly faster.

### View the Generated Site

`open http://0.0.0.0:4000/`
